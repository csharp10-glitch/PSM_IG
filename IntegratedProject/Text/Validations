This Recommendation describes a propagation prediction method suitable for terrestrial point-to-area services
The method provides detailed analysis based on the terrain profile.

frequency range 30 MHz to 3 GHz.

path lengths from 0.25 km up to about 3 000 km distance

terminals within approximately 3 km height above ground.

It predicts signal levels at the median of the multipath distribution
exceeded for a given percentage of time, p%, in the range 1% ≤ p ≤ 50% and a given percentage of locations,
pL, in the range 1% ≤ pL ≤ 99%.
