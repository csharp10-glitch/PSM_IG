Basic radio-meteorological parameters
The prediction procedure requires two radio-meteorological parameters to describe the variability of
atmospheric refractivity.
– ΔN (N-units/km), the average radio-refractive index lapse-rate through the lowest 1 km of
the atmosphere, provides the data upon which the appropriate effective Earth radius can be
calculated for path profile and diffraction obstacle analysis. Note that ΔN is a positive
quantity in this procedure.
– N0 (N-units), the sea-level surface refractivity, is used only by the troposcatter model as a
measure of variability of the troposcatter mechanism.
If local measurements are not available, these quantities can be obtained from the maps in the integral
digital products supplied with this Recommendation. The maps are contained in the files DN50.txt
and N050.txt, respectively. The data are from 0o
to 360o
in longitude and from +90o
to
–90o
in latitude, with a resolution of 1.5o
in both latitude and longitude. The data are used in
conjunction with the companion data files LAT.txt and LON.txt containing respectively the latitudes
and longitudes of the corresponding entries (grid points) in the files DN50.txt and N050.txt. For a
location different from the grid points, the parameter at the desired location can be derived by
performing a bi-linear interpolation on the values at the four closest grid points, as described in
Recommendation ITU-R P.1144.

These digital maps were derived from analysis of a ten-year (1983-1992) global dataset of radiosonde
ascents.
