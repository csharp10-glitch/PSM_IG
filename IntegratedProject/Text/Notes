A procedure is then given for converting to electric field strength
(dB(μV/m)) for an effective radiated power of 1 kW.

In consequence, it is assumed that users of this Recommendation are able to specify detailed terrain
profiles (i.e. elevations above mean sea level) as functions of distance along the great circle paths
(i.e. geodesic curves) between the terminals, for many different terminal locations (receiver-points).
For most practical applications of this method to point-to-area coverage and interference predictions,
this assumption implies the availability of a digital terrain elevation database, referenced to latitude
and longitude with respect to a consistent geodetic datum, from which the terrain profiles may be
extracted by automated means.

Model elements of the propagation prediction method
This propagation prediction method takes account of the following model elements:
– line-of-sight (LoS)
– diffraction (embracing smooth-Earth, irregular terrain and sub-path cases)
– tropospheric scatter

eq 23&24 could be a lot more efficient. we calculate d(tx,rx) 5 or 6 times
default omega to 0 (totaly overland path)
