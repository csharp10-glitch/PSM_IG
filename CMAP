Sequential
For the Sequential plots, the lightness value increases monotonically through the colormaps. This is good. Some of the
L∗ values in the colormaps span from 0 to 100 (binary and the other grayscale), and others start around L∗=20. Those
that have a smaller range of L∗ will accordingly have a smaller perceptual range. Note also that the L∗ function varies
amongst the colormaps: some are approximately linear in L∗ and others are more curved.

Sequential2
Many of the L∗ values from the Sequential2 plots are monotonically increasing, but some (autumn, cool, spring, and
winter) plateau or even go both up and down in L∗ space. Others (afmhot, copper, gist_heat, and hot) have kinks in the
L∗ functions. Data that is being represented in a region of the colormap that is at a plateau or kink will lead to a
perception of banding of the data in those values in the colormap (see [mycarta-banding] for an excellent example of this).

Diverging
For the Diverging maps, we want to have monotonically increasing L∗ values up to a maximum, which should be close to
L∗=100, followed by monotonically decreasing L∗ values. We are looking for approximately equal minimum L∗ values at
opposite ends of the colormap. By these measures, BrBG and RdBu are good options. coolwarm is a good option, but it
doesn't span a wide range of L∗ values (see grayscale section below).

            'PiYG', 'PRGn', 'BrBG', 'PuOr', 'RdGy', 'RdBu',
            'RdYlBu', 'RdYlGn', 'Spectral', 'coolwarm', 'bwr', 'seismic']

Cyclic
For Cyclic maps, we want to start and end on the same color, and meet a symmetric center point in the middle. L∗ should
change monotonically from start to middle, and inversely from middle to end. It should be symmetric on the increasing
and decreasing side, and only differ in hue. At the ends and middle, L∗ will reverse direction, which should be smoothed
in L∗ space to reduce artifacts. See [kovesi-colormaps] for more information on the design of cyclic maps.

The often-used HSV colormap is included in this set of colormaps, although it is not symmetric to a center point.
Additionally, the L∗ values vary widely throughout the colormap, making it a poor choice for representing data for
viewers to see perceptually. See an extension on this idea at [mycarta-jet].

Qualitative
Qualitative colormaps are not aimed at being perceptual maps, but looking at the lightness parameter can verify that for
us. The L∗ values move all over the place throughout the colormap, and are clearly not monotonically increasing. These
would not be good options for use as perceptual colormaps.

cmaps['Qualitative'] = ['Pastel1', 'Pastel2', 'Paired', 'Accent',
                        'Dark2', 'Set1', 'Set2', 'Set3',
                        'tab10', 'tab20', 'tab20b', 'tab20c']

Miscellaneous
Some of the miscellaneous colormaps have particular uses for which they have been created. For example, gist_earth,
ocean, and terrain all seem to be created for plotting topography (green/brown) and water depths (blue) together. We
would expect to see a divergence in these colormaps, then, but multiple kinks may not be ideal, such as in gist_earth
and terrain. CMRmap was created to convert well to grayscale, though it does appear to have some small kinks in L∗.
cubehelix was created to vary smoothly in both lightness and hue, but appears to have a small hump in the green hue area.

The often-used jet colormap is included in this set of colormaps. We can see that the L∗ values vary widely throughout
the colormap, making it a poor choice for representing data for viewers to see perceptually. See an extension on this
idea at [mycarta-jet].
